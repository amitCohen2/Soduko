# Soduko
Soduko Project in C

Soduko game for few players.

1. You choose the number of players and fill their names.
 The active players go inside a List. 
 The list orders by MergeSort. The Sorting criterion is the amount of full squares on the board.
 The ordered players list will enter to Binary Tree for managing all the players in the game with idial efficiency.   
2. Each player get a soduko board game with random numbers that already filled.
3. In each round the algorithem fill the squares that have only one option to fill,
 and give the user an squre with the least options to fill.
 The user choose one option from the options list.
4. If the player win, he will go to the winners List.
5. The game finished when all the players finished their game (loose / win).


In this Algorithem I used List and Binary Tree stractures.
